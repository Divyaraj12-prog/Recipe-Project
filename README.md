📌 Notes

This project currently stores recipes in memory using Context; it does not persist data in a backend or database.

Image uploads are simulated using local browser state.

🛠 Future Improvements

Here’s what could be added next:

✅ Integrate a backend (Node/Express + database)
✅ Add recipe editing & deletion
✅ Add filtering and search
✅ Save images via uploads to storage
✅ Add authentication for personalized recipe lists
